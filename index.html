              My name is Jonathan, I'm 34 years old, I'm living in Quintana Roo and I love to go to the beach in the mornings, especially to enjoy the sunrises on my paddle board.
              I'm currently working as a real estate agent on my own. I enjoy my job, meeting new people and helping families find a new place to call home. I chose to study programming because I believe it’s one of the most valuable skills in today’s world. Technology is shaping everything around us — from the way we communicate to how we work and live. I see programming not just as a career path, but as a way to create solutions, build ideas, and stay connected to an evolving digital world. It gives me the freedom to learn, experiment, and eventually work from anywhere. Starting this journey has been challenging but exciting, and I know it’s an investment in my future and my family’s future.</p>          
            <h3 class="subh3">Puerto Morelos, Quintana Roo</h3>

              Puerto Morelos is a charming coastal town located between Cancun and Playa del Carmen, offering a peaceful and authentic atmosphere.
              Its crystal-clear beaches and coral reef — part of the second largest in the world — make it perfect for ocean lovers.
              Unlike other tourist destinations, here you’ll find tranquility, nature, and a true sense of community.
              Life moves slower, more mindfully, ideal for those looking to disconnect from noise and stress.
              It has all the essential services while preserving its small fishing village charm.
              Living in Puerto Morelos means choosing quality of life, closeness to nature, and a welcoming community.</p>
