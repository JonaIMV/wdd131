            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>
            I started playing rugby thanks to a bet with my brother-in-law after seeing it on TV.<br>
            The following week, in 1984, I attended my first training session at Fort Worth Rugby Club in Fort Worth, Texas.<br>
            I played there for 11 years. Later, we moved to San Antonio, Texas, where I played with the San Antonio Rugby Club from 1995 to 2000.<br>
            After moving to Austin, Texas, I played with the Austin Huns Rugby Club from 2000 to 2007 in Division 1.<br>
            I coached Division 2 and Division 3 teams from 2006 to 2009, when I moved to Puerto Morelos.<br>
            From 2009 to 2015, I coached the Cancún Hammerheads.<br>
            In 2015, I was the coach for the Quintana Roo women's U19 team at the National Olympics in Monterrey, where we won the bronze medal.<br>
            In 2009, I started the youth rugby program “Leopardos Rugby Puerto Morelos.”<br>
            Currently, I serve as the Technical Director for Leopardos Rugby Puerto Morelos and Toros Rugby Infantil (2024).<br>
            In 2025, I became the representative of the organization called “Dilo Asociación de Rugby Juvenil” AC.<br>
            I am a Level 1 Certified Coach and Level 1 Certified Referee with World Rugby Union.
